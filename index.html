        <!-- This header has been the bane of my existence. I've been unable to style its colors and alignments properly, and most of my attempts have broken the existing page in terrible ways. I tried floating h1 to the left for example, but it ended up squashed down into the body of the page for some unfathomable reason.
        
        At least the navbar works properly.-->

        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <img id="mugshot" src="assets/images/8-bitme.jpg" alt="broken image"><p id="about">Welcome to my portfolio! My name (as you may have guessed by this point) is Paul Unsted. I am currently 35 years old, and self-employed. I offer freelance business administration, helping small companies tackle anything from graphic design and marketing strategies to invoicing and customer service.
        </p>
        <p id="about">I have a score of hobbies and interests: I love videogames, films, books, beers, conversation, music (both its consumption and creation) and many other things. I have lived on Vancouver Island, in England, and visited Australia and Paris.</p>
        <p id="about">It is my fervent hope that the skills that I am learning in my continuing education class will open all manner of new career options for me. I've already learned quite a bit, but the real challenge is yet to come!</p>
